          <br>  If you ever find yourself stuck in the middle of the sea<br>
            I'll sail the world to find you<br>
            If you ever find yourself lost in the dark and you can't see<br>
            I'll be the light to guide you<br>
            
           <br> Find out what we're made of<br>
            When we are called to help our friends in need<br>
            
            <br>[Chorus]<br>
            You can count on me like 1, 2, 3<br>
            I'll be there<br>
            And I know when I need it<br>
            I can count on you like 4, 3, 2<br>
            And you'll be there<br>
            'cause that's what friends are supposed to do oh yeah<br>
            ooooooh, oooohhh yeah yeah<br>
            
            <br>[Verse 2]<br>
            If you're tossin' and you're turnin<br>
            and you just can't fall asleep<br>
            I'll sing a song beside you<br>
            And if you ever forget how much you really mean to me<br>
            Every day I will remind you<br>
            
            <br> Find out what we're made of<br>
            When we are called to help our friends in need<br>
            
            <br> [Chorus]<br>
            You can count on me like 1, 2, 3<br>
            I'll be there<br>
            And I know when I need it<br>
            I can count on you like 4, 3, 2<br>
            And you'll be there<br>
            'cause that's what friends are supposed to do oh yeah<br>
            ooooooh, oooohhh yeah yeah<br>
            
            <br> You'll always have my shoulder when you cry<br>
            I'll never let go<br>
            Never say goodbye<br>
            
            <br> [Chorus]<br>
            Oh, You can count on me like 1, 2, 3<br>
            I'll be there<br>
            And I know when I need it<br>

            And you'll be there<br>
            'cause that's what friends are supposed to do oh yeah<br>
            ooooooh, oooohhh<br>
